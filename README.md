Resources for React Native Development

# Expo 
- Has a lot of apis that allow you to build much faster. With Expo you won't have to touch any native code and you can eject anytime you wan't. Although if you use any of their built in apis like audio recording or image manipulation if you eject they will no longer work. Using expo is highly recommended for devs just getting started with React Native and I would guess could potentially cut your dev time by ~1/3 depending on the app.

# React Navigation
- To handle navigation you will probably need to use a library. I would highly recommend react navigation over react native navigation. I know similar names but they are different libraries and have different tradeoffs. React Navigation is the most popular navigation library and has great docs.

# Create React Native App
- Get started building a react native app much faster by using this tool. Highly recommended for beginner React Native devs.

# Firebase
- Very commonly used Baas for react native projects. You could of course host your own server and database, but firebase has a lot of great features built in that work well with React Native that can cut your development time down. For example you can set up push notifications with firebase and expo: https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/using-fcm/

# Redux
- Although not strictly required it is one of the most commonly used state management systems in the react and react native ecosystem. Works essentially the same way as in a react js project.
